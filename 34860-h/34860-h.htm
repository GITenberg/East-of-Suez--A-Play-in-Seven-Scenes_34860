<h3><a name="SCENE_I" id="SCENE_I"></a>SCENE I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <i>A street in Peking</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang"><i>Several shops are shown. Their fronts are richly decorated with
carved wood painted red and profusely gilt. The counters are
elaborately carved. Outside are huge sign-boards. The shops are
open to the street and you can see the various wares they sell. One
is a coffin shop, where the coolies are at work on a coffin: other
coffins, ready for sale, are displayed; some of them are of plain
deal, others are rich, with black and gold. The next shop is a
money changer's. Then there is a lantern shop in which all manner
of coloured lanterns are hanging. After this comes a druggist where
there are queer things in bottles and dried herbs. A small stuffed
crocodile is a prominent object. Next to this is a shop where
crockery is sold, large coloured jars, plates, and all manner of
strange animals. In all the shops two or three Chinamen are seated.
Some read newspapers through great horn spectacles; some smoke
water pipes.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>The street is crowded. Here is an itinerant cook with his two
chests, in one of which is burning charcoal: he serves out bowls of
rice and condiments to the passers-by who want food. There is a
barber with the utensils of his trade. A coolie, seated on a stool,
is having his head shaved. Chinese walk to and fro.</i><a name="page_012" id="page_012"></a></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Some are coolies and wear blue cotton in various stages of
raggedness; some in black gowns and caps and black shoes are
merchants and clerks. There is a beggar, gaunt and thin, with an
untidy mop of bristly hair, in tatters of indescribable filthiness.
He stops at one of the shops and begins a long wail. For a time no
one takes any notice of him, but presently on a word from the fat
shopkeeper an assistant gives him a few cash and he wanders on.
Coolies, half naked, hurry by, bearing great bales on their yokes.
They utter little sharp cries for people to get out of their way.
Peking carts with their blue hoods rumble noisily along. Rickshaws
pass rapidly in both directions, and the rickshaw boys shout for
the crowd to make way. In the rickshaws are grave Chinese. Some are
dressed in white ducks after the European fashion; in other
rickshaws are Chinese women in long smocks and wide trousers or
Manchu ladies, with their faces painted like masks, in embroidered
silks. Women of various sorts stroll about the street or enter the
shops. You see them chaffering for various articles.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>A water-carrier passes along with a creaking barrow, slopping the
water as he goes; an old blind woman, a masseuse, advances slowly,
striking wooden clappers to proclaim her calling. A musician stands
on the curb and plays a tuneless melody on a one-stringed fiddle.
From the distance comes the muffled sound of gongs. There is a
babel of sound caused by the talking of all these people, by the
cries of coolies, the gong, the clappers, and the fiddle. From
burning joss-sticks in the shops in front of the household god
comes a savour of incense.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>A couple of Mongols ride across on shaggy ponies; they wear high
boots and Astrakhan caps. Then a string of camels sways slowly down
the street. They carry great burdens of skins from the deserts of
Mongolia. They are accompanied by wild looking fellows. Two stout
Chinese gentlemen are giving their pet birds an airing; the birds<a name="page_013" id="page_013"></a>
are attached by the leg with a string and sit on little wooden
perches. The two Chinese gentlemen discuss their merits. Round
about them small boys play. They run hither and thither pursuing
one another amid the crowd.</i></p></div>

<p class="hang"><i>A small verandah on an upper storey of the British American Tobacco
Company's premises, the upper part of which the staff lives in. At the
back are heavy arches of whitewashed masonry and a low wall which serves
as a parapet. Green blinds are drawn. There is a bamboo table on which
are copies of illustrated papers. A couple of long bamboo chairs and two
or three smaller arm chairs. The floor is tiled.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>On one of the long chairs</i> <span class="smcap">Harold Knox</span> <i>is lying asleep. He is a young
man of pleasing appearance</i>. <i>He wears white ducks, but he has taken off
his coat, which lies on a chair, and his collar and tie and pin. They
are on the table by his side. He is troubled by a fly and, half waking
but with his eyes still closed, tries to drive it away.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> Curse it. [<i>He opens his eyes and yawns.</i>] Boy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wu.</span> [<i>Outside.</i>] Ye.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> What's the time?</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Wu</span> <i>comes in; he is a Chinese servant in a long white gown with a black
cap on his head</i>. <i>He bears a tray on which is a bottle of whisky, a
glass and a syphon.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wu.</span> My no sabe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> Anyhow it's time for a whisky and soda. [<span class="smcap">Wu</span> <i>puts the tray down on
the table</i>. <span class="smcap">Knox</span> <i>smiles</i>.] Intelligent anticipation. Model servant and
all that sort of thing. [<span class="smcap">Wu</span> <i>pours out the whisky</i>.] You don't care if I
drink myself to death, Wu&mdash;do you? [<span class="smcap">Wu</span> <i>smiles, showing all his teeth</i>.]
Fault of the climate. Give me the glass. [<span class="smcap">Wu</span> <i>does so</i>.] You're like a
mother to me, Wu. [<i>He drinks and puts down the glass.</i>] By George, I
feel another man. The bull-dog breed, Wu. Never say die. Rule
Britannia.<a name="page_018" id="page_018"></a> Pull up the blinds, you lazy blighter. The sun's off and the
place is like a oven.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Wu</span> <i>goes over and pulls up one blind after the other</i>. <i>An expanse of
blue sky is seen.</i> <span class="smcap">Henry Anderson</span> <i>comes in</i>. <i>He is a man of thirty,
fair, good-looking, with a pleasant, honest face. His obvious
straightforwardness and sincerity make him attractive.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> [<i>Breezily.</i>] Hulloa, Harold, you seem to be taking it easy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> There was nothing to do in the office and I thought I'd get in my
beauty sleep while I had the chance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> I thought you had your beauty sleep before midnight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> I'm taking time by the forelock so as to be on the safe side.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Are you going on the loose again to-night?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> Again, Henry?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> You were blind last night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> [<i>With great satisfaction.</i>] Paralytic.... Hulloa, who's this?
[<i>He catches sight of the</i> <span class="smcap">Amah</span> <i>who has just entered</i>. <i>She is a
little, thin, wrinkled, elderly Chinawoman in a long smock and trousers.
She has gold pins in her sleek black hair. When she sees she has been
noticed she smiles obsequiously.</i>] Well, fair charmer, what can we do
for you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> What does she want, Wu?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> Is this the face that launched a thousand ships?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amah.</span> My Missy have pay my letter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> [<i>With sudden eager interest.</i>] Are you Mrs. Rathbone's amah?
Have you got a letter for me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amah.</span> My belong Missy Rathbone amah.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Well, hurry up, don't be all night about it. Lend me a dollar,
Harold. I want to give it to the old girl.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">[<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Amah</span> <i>takes a note out of her sleeve and gives it to</i> <span class="smcap">Harry</span>.
<i>He opens it and reads.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> I haven't got a dollar. Give her a chit or ask Wu. He's the only
man I know who's got any money.<a name="page_019" id="page_019"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Let me have a dollar, Wu. Chop-chop.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wu.</span> My go catchee.</p>

<p>[<i>He goes out.</i> <i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Amah</span> <i>is standing near the table</i>. <i>While</i> <span class="smcap">Knox</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Harry</span> <i>go on talking she notices</i> <span class="smcap">Knox's</span> <i>pin</i>. <i>She smiles and
smiles and makes little bows to the two men, but at the same time her
hand cautiously reaches out for the pin and closes on it. Then she
secretes it in her sleeve.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> I thought you were going to play tennis this afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> So I am later on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> [<i>Smiling.</i>] Do it now, dear boy. That is a precept a business
man should never forget.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> I should hate to think you wanted to be rid of me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> I dote on your company, but I feel that I mustn't be selfish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> [<i>Pulling his leg.</i>] To tell you the truth I don't feel very fit
to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> A little bilious, I dare say. Half a dozen hard sets are just
what you want. [<i>He hands</i> <span class="smcap">Knox</span> <i>his coat</i>.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> What is this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Your coat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> You're making yourself almost more distressingly plain than nature
has already made you.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Wu</span> <i>comes back and hands</i> <span class="smcap">Harry</span> <i>a dollar, and then goes out</i>. <span class="smcap">Harry</span>
<i>gives the dollar to the</i> <span class="smcap">Amah</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Here's a dollar for you, amah. You go back to missy and tell her
it's all right and will she come chop-chop. Sabe?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amah.</span> My sabe. Goo'-bye.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> God bless you, dearie. It's done me good to see your winsome
little face.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> [<i>With a smile.</i>] Shut up, Harold.</p>

<p>[<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Amah</span> <i>with nods, smiles and bows, goes out</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> Harry, my poor friend, is it possible that you have an
assignation?<a name="page_020" id="page_020"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> What is possible is that if you don't get out quick I'll throw
you out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> Why didn't you say you were expecting a girl?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> I'm not; I'm expecting a lady.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> Are you sure you know how to behave? If you'd like me to stay and
see you don't do the wrong thing I'll chuck my tennis. I'm always ready
to sacrifice myself for a friend.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Has it struck you that the distance from the verandah to the
street is very considerable?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> And the pavement is hard. I flatter myself I can take a hint. I
wonder where the devil my pin is. I left it on the table.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> I expect Wu put it away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> It's much more likely that old woman pinched it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Oh, nonsense. She wouldn't dream of such a thing. I believe Mrs.
Rathbone's had her for ages.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> Who is Mrs. Rathbone?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> [<i>Not wishing to be questioned.</i>] A friend of mine.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">George Conway</span> <i>comes in</i>. <i>He is a tall, dark man in the early
thirties. He is a handsome, well-built fellow, of a somewhat rugged
appearance, but urbane and self-assured.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> May I come in?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> [<i>Eagerly, shaking him warmly by the hand.</i>] At last. By Jove,
it's good to see you again. You know Knox, don't you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> I think so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> I wash bottles in the B. A. T. I don't expect the legation bloods
to be aware of my existence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>With a twinkle in his eye.</i>] I don't know that an Assistant
Chinese Secretary is such a blood as all that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> You've just been down to Fuchow, haven't you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Yes, I only got back this morning.<a name="page_021" id="page_021"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> Did you see Freddy Baker by any chance?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Yes, poor chap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> Oh, I've got no pity for him. He's just a damned fool.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> Haven't you heard? He's married a half-caste.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> What of it? I believe she's a very pretty girl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> I daresay she is. But hang it all, he needn't have married her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> I don't think it was a very wise thing to do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> I should have thought all those prejudices were out of date. Why
shouldn't a man marry a half-caste if he wants to?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> It can't be very nice to have a wife whom even the missionary
ladies turn up their noses at.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> [<i>With a shrug of the shoulders.</i>] You wait till Freddy's number
one in Hankow and can entertain. I bet the white ladies will be glad
enough to know his missus then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Yes, but that's just it. He'll never get a good job with a
Eurasian wife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> He's in Jardine's, isn't he? Do you mean to say it's going to
handicap a man in a shipping firm because he's married a woman who's
partly Chinese?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Of course it is. Jardine's are about the most important firm in
China and the manager of one of their principal branches has definite
social obligations. Freddy Baker will be sent to twopenny halfpenny
outports where his wife doesn't matter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> I think he's damned lucky if he's not asked to resign.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> It's cruel. His wife may be a charming and cultivated woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> Have you ever known a half-caste that was?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> I have.<a name="page_022" id="page_022"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> Well, I've been in this country for seven years and I've never met
one, male or female, that didn't give me the shivers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> I've no patience with you. You're a perfect damned fool.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> [<i>A little surprised, but quite good-humoured.</i>] You're getting
rather excited, aren't you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> [<i>Hotly.</i>] I hate injustice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Do you think it really is injustice? The English are not an
unkindly race. If they've got a down on half-castes there are probably
very good grounds for it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> What are they?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> We don't much like their morals, but we can't stick their manners.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Somehow or other they seem to inherit all the bad qualities of
the two races from which they spring and none of the good ones. I'm sure
there are exceptions, but on the whole the Eurasian is vulgar and noisy.
He can't tell the truth if he tries.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> To do him justice, he seldom tries.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> He's as vain as a peacock. He'll cringe when he's afraid of you
and he'll bully when he's not. You can never rely on him. He's crooked
from the crown of his German hat to the toes of his American boots.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> Straight from the shoulder. Take the count, old man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> [<i>Frigidly.</i>] Oughtn't you to be going?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> [<i>Smiling.</i>] No, but I will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> I'm sorry if I was rude to you just now, old man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> Silly ass, you've broken no bones; my self-esteem, thank God, is
unimpaired. [<i>He goes out.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> I say, I'm awfully glad you're back, George. You can't think how
I miss you when you're away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> As soon as the shooting starts we'll try and get two or three
days together in the country.<a name="page_023" id="page_023"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Yes, that would be jolly. [<i>Calling.</i>] Wu.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wu.</span> [<i>Outside.</i>] Ye'.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Bring tea for three.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Who is the third?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> When you said you could come round I asked somebody I want you
very much to meet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Who is that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Mrs. Rathbone ... I'm going to be married to her and we want you
to be our best man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Harry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> [<i>Boyishly.</i>] I thought you'd be surprised.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> My dear old boy, I am so glad. I hope you'll be awfully happy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> I'm awfully happy now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Why have you kept it so dark?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> I didn't want to say anything till it was all settled. Besides,
I've only known her six weeks. I met her when I was down in Shanghai....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Is she a widow?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Yes, she was married to an American in the F. M. S.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Is she American?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Only by marriage. I'm afraid she didn't have a very happy married
life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Poor thing. I think I'd take a small bet that you won't beat
her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> I mean to try my best to make her happy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> You old fool, I've never known a man who was likely to make a
better husband.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> I'm most awfully in love with her, George.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Isn't that ripping? How old is she?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Only twenty-two. She's the loveliest thing you ever saw.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> And is she in love with you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> She says so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> She damned well ought to be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> I do hope you'll like her, George.<a name="page_024" id="page_024"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Of course I shall. You're not the sort of chap to fall in love
with a woman who isn't nice.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Harry</span> <i>walks up and down for a moment restlessly</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Will you have a whisky and soda?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> No, thanks ... I'll wait for tea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> She ought to be here in a moment. [<i>Suddenly making up his
mind.</i>] It's no good beating about the bush. I may as well tell you at
once. Her&mdash;her mother was Chinese.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>Unable to conceal his dismay.</i>] Oh, Harry. [<i>A pause.</i>] I wish
I hadn't said all that I did just now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Of course you didn't know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>Gravely.</i>] I should have had to say something very like it,
Harry. But I shouldn't have put it so bluntly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> You said yourself there were exceptions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> I know. [<i>Distressed.</i>] Won't your people be rather upset?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> I don't see how it can matter to them. They're nine thousand
miles away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Who was her father?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Oh, he was a merchant. He's dead. And her mother is too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> That's something. I don't think you'd much like having a Chinese
mother-in-law about the place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> George, you won't let it make any difference, will you? We've
known one another all our lives.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> My dear old chap, as far as I'm concerned I shouldn't care if
you married the first cousin of the Ace of Spades. I don't want you to
make a hash of things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Wait till you see her. She's the most fascinating thing you ever
met.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Yes, they can be charming. I was awfully in love with a
half&mdash;with a Eurasian girl myself years ago. It was before you came out
to the country. I wanted to marry her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Why didn't you?<a name="page_025" id="page_025"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> It was up in Chung-king. I'd just been appointed vice-consul. I
was only twenty-three. The Minister wired from Peking that I'd have to
resign if I did. I hadn't a bob except my salary and they transferred me
to Canton to get me away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> It's different for you. You're in the service and you may be
Minister one of these days. I'm only a merchant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Even for you there'll be difficulties, you know. Has it occurred
to you that the white ladies won't be very nice?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> I can do without their society.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> You must know some people. It means you'll have to hobnob with
Eurasian clerks and their wives. I'm afraid you'll find it pretty
rotten.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> If you'll stick to me I don't care.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> I suppose you've absolutely made up your mind?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Absolutely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> In that case I've got nothing more to say. You can't expect me
not to be a little disappointed, but after all the chief thing is your
happiness, and whatever I can do I will. You can put your shirt on that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> You're a brick, George.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> The little lady ought to be here, oughtn't she?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> I think I hear her on the stairs.</p>

<p>[<i>He goes to the entrance and then out.</i> <span class="smcap">Wu</span> <i>brings in the tea and sets
it on the table</i>. <span class="smcap">George</span> <i>walks over to the parapet and looks
thoughtfully before him</i>. <i>There is a sound of voices in the adjoining
room.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> [<i>Outside.</i>] Come in; he's on the verandah.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Outside.</i>] One brief look in the glass and then I'm ready.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Harry</span> <i>enters</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> She's just coming.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> I bet she's powdering her nose.<a name="page_026" id="page_026"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Here I am.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Daisy</span> <i>enters</i>. <span class="smcap">She</span> <i>is an extremely pretty woman, beautifully, perhaps
a little showily, dressed</i>. <i>She has a pale, very clear, slightly sallow
skin, and beautiful dark eyes. There is only the very faintest suspicion
in them of the Chinese slant. Her hair is abundant and black.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> This is George Conway, Daisy.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">George</span> <i>stares at her</i>. <i>At first he is not quite sure that he
recognizes her, then suddenly he does, but only the slightest movement
of the eyes betrays him.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> How do you do. I told Harry I had an idea I must have met you
somewhere. I don't think I have after all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> George flatters himself he's not easily forgotten.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> But I've heard so much about you from Harry that I feel as though
we were old friends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> It's very kind of you to say so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Supposing you poured out the tea, Daisy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> I'm dying for a cup.</p>

<p>[<i>She sits down and proceeds to do so.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Harry is very anxious that you should like me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> George and I have known one another since we were kids. His
people and mine live quite close to one another at home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> But I'm not blaming you. I'm only wondering how I shall
ingratiate myself with him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> He looks rather severe, but he isn't really. I think you've only
got to be your natural charming self.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Have you told him about the house?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> No. [<i>To George.</i>] You know the temple the Harrisons used to
have. We've taken that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Oh, it's a ripping place. But won't you find it rather a
nuisance to have those old monks on the top of you all the time?<a name="page_027" id="page_027"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Oh, I don't think so. Our part is quite separate, you know, and
the Harrisons made it very comfortable.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Harold Knox</span> <i>comes in</i>. <i>He has changed into tennis things.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> I say, Harry ... [<i>He sees</i> <span class="smcap">Daisy</span>.] Oh, I beg your pardon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Mr. Knox&mdash;Mrs. Rathbone.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Knox</span> <i>gives her a curt nod, but she holds out her hand affably</i>. <i>He
takes it.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> How do you do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> I'm sorry to disturb you, Harry, but old Ku Faung Min is
downstairs and wants to see you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Tell him to go to blazes. The office is closed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> He's going to Hankow to-night and he says he must see you before
he goes. He's got some big order to give.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Oh, curse him. I know what he is. He'll keep me talking for half
an hour. D'you mind if I leave you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Of course not. It'll give me a chance of making Mr. Conway's
acquaintance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> I'll get rid of him as quickly as I can.</p>

<p>[<i>He goes out accompanied by Knox.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> [<i>As he goes.</i>] Good-bye.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">George</span> <i>looks at</i> <span class="smcap">Daisy</span> <i>for a moment</i>. <i>She smiles at him. There is a
silence.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Why didn't you warn me that it was you I was going to meet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I didn't know what you'd say about me to Harry if you knew.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> It was rather a risk, wasn't it? Supposing I'd blurted out the
truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I trusted to your diplomatic training. Besides, I'd prepared for
it. I told him I thought I'd met you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Harry and I have been pals all our lives. I brought him out to
China and I got him his job. When he<a name="page_028" id="page_028"></a> had cholera he would have died if
I hadn't pulled him through.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I know. And in return he worships the ground you tread on. I've
never known one man think so much of another as he does of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> All that's rot, of course. Sometimes I don't know how I'm going
to live up to the good opinion Harry has of me. But when you've done so
much for a pal as I have for him it gives you an awful sense of
responsibility towards him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> What do you mean by that?</p>

<p>[<i>A short pause.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> I'm not going to let you marry him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> He's so much in love with me that he doesn't know what to do with
himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> I know he is. But if you were in love with him you wouldn't be
so sure of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>With a sudden change of tone.</i>] Why not? I was sure of your
love. And God knows I was in love with you.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">George</span> <i>makes a gesture of dismay</i>. <i>He is taken aback for a moment,
but he quickly recovers.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> You don't know what sort of a man Harry is. He's not like the
fellows you've been used to. He's never knocked around as most of us do.
He's always been as straight as a die.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Have mercy on him. Even if there were nothing else against you
he's not the sort of chap for you to marry. He's awfully English.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> If he doesn't mind marrying a Eurasian I really don't see what
business it is of yours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> But you know very well that that isn't the only thing against
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I haven't an idea what you mean.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Haven't you? You forget the war. When we heard there was a very
pretty young woman, apparently<a name="page_029" id="page_029"></a> with plenty of money, living at the Hong
Kong Hotel on very familiar terms with a lot of naval fellows, it became
our business to make enquiries. I think I know everything there is
against you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Have you any right to make use of information you've acquired
officially?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Don't be a fool, Daisy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Passionately.</i>] Tell him then. You'll break his heart. You'll
make him utterly wretched. But he'll marry me all the same. When a man's
as much in love as he is he'll forgive everything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> I think it's horrible. If you loved him you couldn't marry him.
It's heartless.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Violently.</i>] How dare you say that? You. You. You know what I
am. Yes, it's all true. I don't know what you know but it can't be worse
than the truth. And whose fault is it? Yours. If I'm rotten it's you who
made me rotten.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> I? No. You've got no right to say that. It's cruel. It's
infamous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I've touched you at last, have I? Because you know it's true.
Don't you remember when I first came to Chung-king? I was seventeen. My
father had sent me to England to school when I was seven. I never saw
him for ten years. And at last he wrote and said I was to come back to
China. You came and met me on the boat and told me my father had had a
stroke and was dead. You took me to the Presbyterian mission.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> That was my job. I was awfully sorry for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> And then in a day or two you came and told me that my father
hadn't left anything and what there was went to his relations in
England.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Naturally he didn't expect to die.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Passionately.</i>] If he was going to leave me like that why
didn't he let me stay with my Chinese mother? Why did he bring me up
like a lady? Oh, it was cruel.<a name="page_030" id="page_030"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Yes. It was unpardonable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I was so lonely and so frightened. You seemed to be sorry for me.
You were the only person who was really kind to me. You were practically
the first man I'd known. I loved you. I thought you loved me. Oh, say
that you loved me then, George.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> You know I did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I was very innocent in those days. I thought that when two people
loved one another they married. I wasn't a Eurasian then, George. I was
like any other English girl. If you'd married me I shouldn't be what I
am now. But they took you away from me. You never even said good-bye to
me. You wrote and told me you'd been transferred to Canton.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> I couldn't say good-bye to you, Daisy. They said that if I
married you I'd have to leave the service. I was absolutely penniless.
They dinned it into my ears that if a white man marries a Eurasian he's
done for. I wouldn't listen to them, but in my heart I knew it was true.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I don't blame you. You wanted to get on, and you have, haven't
you? You're Assistant Chinese Secretary already and Harry says you'll be
Minister before you've done. It seems rather hard that I should have had
to pay the price.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Daisy, you'll never know what anguish I suffered. I can't expect
you to care. It's very natural if you hate me. I was ambitious. I didn't
want to be a failure. I knew that it was madness to marry you. I had to
kill my love. I couldn't. It was stronger than I was. At last I couldn't
help myself. I made up my mind to chuck everything and take the
consequences. I was just starting for Chung-king when I heard you were
living in Shanghai with a rich Chinaman.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Daisy</span> <i>gives a little moan</i>. <i>There is a silence.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> They hated me at the mission. They found fault with me from
morning till night. They blamed me<a name="page_031" id="page_031"></a> because you wanted to marry me and
they treated me as if I was a designing cat. When you went away they
heaved a sigh of relief. Then they started to convert me. They thought
I'd better become a school teacher. They hated me because I was
seventeen. They hated me because I was pretty. Oh, the brutes. They
killed all the religion I'd got. There was only one person who seemed to
care if I was alive or dead. That was my mother. Oh, I was so ashamed
the first time I saw her. At school in England I'd told them so often
that she was a Chinese princess that I almost believed it myself. My
mother was a dirty little ugly Chinawoman. I'd forgotten all my Chinese
and I had to talk to her in English. She asked me if I'd like to go to
Shanghai with her. I was ready to do anything in the world to get away
from the mission and I thought in Shanghai I shouldn't be so far away
from you. They didn't want me to go, but they couldn't keep me against
my will. When we got to Shanghai she sold me to Lee Tai Cheng for two
thousand dollars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> How terrible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I've never had a chance. Oh, George, isn't it possible for a
woman to turn over a new leaf? You say that Harry's good and kind. Don't
you see what that means to me? Because he'll think me good I shall be
good. After all, he couldn't have fallen in love with me if I'd been
entirely worthless. I hate the life I've led. I want to go straight. I
swear I'll make him a good wife. Oh, George, if you ever loved me have
pity on me. If Harry doesn't marry me I'm done.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> How can a marriage be happy that's founded on a tissue of lies?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I've never told Harry a single lie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> You told him you hadn't been happily married.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> That wasn't a lie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> You haven't been married at all.<a name="page_032" id="page_032"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>With a roguish look.</i>] Well then, I haven't been happily
married, have I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Who was this fellow Rathbone?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> He was an American in business at Singapore. I met him in
Shanghai. I hated Lee. Rathbone asked me to go to Singapore with him and
I went. I lived with him for four years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Then you went back to Lee Tai Cheng.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Rathbone died. There was nothing else to do. My mother was always
nagging me to go back to him. He's rich and she makes a good thing out
of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> I thought she was dead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> No. I told Harry she was because I thought it would make it
easier for him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> She isn't with you now, is she?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> No, she lives at Ichang. She doesn't bother me as long as I send
her something every month.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Why did you tell Harry that you were twenty-two? It's ten years
since you came to China and you were seventeen then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>With a twinkle in her eye.</i>] Any woman of my age will tell you
that seventeen and ten are twenty-two.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">George</span> <i>does not smile</i>. <i>With frowning brow he walks up and down.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Oh, I wish to God I knew nothing about you. I can't bring myself
to tell him and yet how can I let him marry you in absolute ignorance?
Oh, Daisy, for your sake as well as for his I beseech you to tell him
the whole truth and let him decide for himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> And break his heart? There's not a missionary who believes in God
as he believes in me. If he loses his trust in me he loses everything.
Tell him if you think you must, if you have no pity, if you have no
regret for all the shame and misery you brought on me, you, you,
you&mdash;but if you do, I swear, I swear to God that I shall kill myself. I
won't go back to that hateful life.</p>

<p>[<i>He looks at her earnestly for a moment.</i><a name="page_033" id="page_033"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> I don't know if I'm doing right or wrong. I shall tell him
nothing.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Daisy</span> <i>gives a deep sigh of relief</i>, <span class="smcap">Harry</span> <i>comes in</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> I say, I'm awfully sorry to have been so long. I couldn't get the
old blighter to go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>With complete self-control.</i>] If I say you've been an age it'll
look as though Mr. Conway had been boring me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> I hope you've made friends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">George</span>.] Have we?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> I hope so. But now I think I must bolt. I have a long Chinese
document to translate. [<i>Holding out his hand to</i> <span class="smcap">Daisy</span>.] I hope you'll
both be very happy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I think I'm going to like you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Good-bye, Harry, old man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> I shall see you later on in the club, sha'n't I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> If I can get through my work.</p>

<p>[<i>He goes out.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> What have you and George been talking about?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> We discussed the house. It'll be great fun buying the things for
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> I could have killed that old Chink for keeping me so long. I
grudge every minute that I spend away from you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> It's nice to be loved.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> You do love me a little, don't you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> A little more than a little, my lamb.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> I wish I were more worth your while. You've made me feel so
dissatisfied with myself. I'm such a rotter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> You're not going to disagree with me already.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> What about?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> About you. I think you're a perfect duck.</p>

<p>[<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Amah</span> <i>appears</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Oh, it's my amah.<a name="page_034" id="page_034"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> I didn't recognize her for a moment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> She doesn't approve of my being alone with strange gentlemen. She
looks after me as if I was a child of ten.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amah.</span> Velly late, missy Daisy. Time you come along.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Oh, nonsense.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> She wants me to go and be fitted. She never lets me go out in
Peking alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> She's quite right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Amah, come and be introduced to the gentleman. He's going to be
your master now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amah.</span> [<i>Smiling, with little nods.</i>] Velly nice gentleman. You keep
missy Daisy old amah&mdash;yes? Velly good amah&mdash;yes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> She's been with me ever since I was a child.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Of course we'll keep her. She was with you when you were in
Singapore?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>With a little sigh.</i>] Yes, I don't know what I should have done
without her sometimes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Oh, Daisy, I do want to make you forget all the unhappiness you
have suffered.</p>

courtyard of the temple is shown. At the back is the sanctuary in
which is seen the altar table; on this are two large vases in each

and in the middle there is a sand-box in which are burning
joss-sticks; behind is the image of Buddha. The sanctuary can be
closed by huge doors. These are now open. A flight of steps leads
up to it.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>A service is finishing. The monks are seen on each side of the
altar kneeling in two rows. They are clad in grey gowns and their
heads are shaven. They sing the invocation to Buddha, repeating the

monks form a procession and two by two, still singing, come down
the steps and go out. A tiny acolyte blows out the oil lamps and

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> What should be the matter?</p>

me and a nice house to live in. I've got a position and as much money as

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Don't be an old fool. I'm not a child any more. [<i>Desperately.</i>]
I'm growing older, older, older. And every day is just like every other

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> For me? It must have cost five hundred dollars. Who is it from?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amah.</span> To-day is my little Daisy's wedding-day. She have married one

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> YOU! Have you ever given me anything but a beating?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> How dare you? How dare you? I told you that you were never to let
Lee Tai speak to you again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amah.</span> You very angry, Daisy. You very angry before, but you go back to
Lee Tai; he think perhaps you go back again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Tell him that I loathe the sight of him. Tell him that if I were
starving I wouldn't take a penny from him. Tell him that if he dares to
come round here I'll have him beaten till he screams.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amah.</span> Hi, hi.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> And you leave me alone, will you. Harry hates you. I've only got
to say a word and he'll kick you out in five minutes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amah.</span> What would my little Daisy do without old amah, hi, hi? What for
you no talkee true? You think old amah no got eyes? [<i>With a cunning,

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> What's that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amah.</span> I got letter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Snatching it from her.</i>] Give it me. How dare you hide it?</p>

when Harry there. [<span class="smcap">Daisy</span> <i>tears it open</i>.] What he say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Reading.</i>] "I'm awfully sorry I can't dine with you on
Thursday, but I'm engaged. I've just remembered it's your wedding-day

<p><span class="smcap">Amah.</span> Why you no talkee old amah?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Desperately.</i>] I can't help myself. Oh, I love him so. What

him love me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amah.</span> You see, you want old amah.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Oh, I'm so unhappy. I think I shall go mad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amah.</span> Sh, sh. Perhaps he love you too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Never. He hates me. Why does he avoid me? He never comes here. At
first he was always looking in. He used to come out and dine two or
three days a week. What have I done to him? He only comes now because he
does not want to offend Harry. Harry, Harry, what do I care for Harry?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amah.</span> Sh. Don't let him see. Give amah the letter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> I say, Daisy, I've just had the ponies saddled. Put on your habit
and let's go for a ride.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I've got a headache.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Oh, my poor child. Why don't you lie down?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I thought I was better in the air. But there's no reason why you
shouldn't ride.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Oh, no, I won't ride without you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Why on earth not? It'll do you good. You know when my head's bad
I only want to be left alone. Your pony wants exercising.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> The boy can do that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Trying to conceal her growing exasperation.</i>] Please do as I
ask. I'd rather you went.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> [<i>Laughing.</i>] Of course if you're so anxious to get rid of me....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Smiling.</i>] I can't bear that you should be done out of your
ride. If you won't go alone you'll just force me to come with you.<a name="page_041" id="page_041"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> I'll go. Give me a kiss before I do. [<i>She puts up her lips to
his.</i>] I'm almost ashamed of myself, I'm just as madly in love with you
as the day we were married.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> You are a dear. Have a nice ride, and when you come back I shall
be all right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> That's ripping. I shan't be very long.</p>

<p>[<i>He goes out. The lightness, the smile, with which she has spoken to
Harry disappear as he goes, and she looks worried and anxious.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Supposing they meet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amah.</span> No can. Harry go out back way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Yes, I suppose he will. I wish he'd be quick. [<i>Violently.</i>] I
must see George.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amah.</span> [<i>Picking up the necklace.</i>] Velly pletty necklace. You silly
girl. Why you no take?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Oh, damn, why can't you leave me alone? [<i>Listening.</i>] What on
earth is Harry doing? I thought the pony was saddled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amah.</span> [<i>Looking at the necklace.</i>] What shall I do with this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Throw it in the dust-bin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amah.</span> Lee Tai no likee that very much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Hearing the sound of the pony, with a sigh of relief.</i>] He's
gone. Now I'm safe. Where's my bag? [<i>She takes a little mirror out of
it and looks at herself.</i>] I look perfectly hideous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amah.</span> Don't be silly. You velly pletty girl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Her ears all alert.</i>] There's someone riding along.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amah.</span> That not pony. That Peking cart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> You old fool, I tell you it's a pony. At last. Oh, my heart's
beating so.... It's stopping at the gate. It's George. Oh, I love him. I
love him. [<i>To the</i> <span class="smcap">Amah</span>, <i>stamping her foot</i>.] What are you waiting
for? I don't want you here now, and don't listen, d'you hear. Get out,
get out.<a name="page_042" id="page_042"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amah.</span> All-light. My go away.</p>

<p>[<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Amah</span> <i>slinks away</i>. <span class="smcap">Daisy</span> <i>stands waiting for</i> <span class="smcap">George</span>, <i>holding
her hands to her heart as though to stop the anguish of its beating</i>.

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Hulloa, what are you doing here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I was tired of sitting in the drawing-room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> I remembered it was your wedding-day. I've brought you a few
flowers. [<i>She takes them with both hands.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Thank you. That <i>is</i> kind of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>Gravely.</i>] I hope you'll always be very happy. I hope you'll
allow me to say how grateful I am that you've given Harry so much
happiness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> You're very solemn. One would almost think you'd prepared that
pretty speech beforehand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>Trying to take it lightly.</i>] I'm sorry if it didn't sound
natural. I can promise you it was sincere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Shall we sit down?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> I think we ought to go for our ride while the light lasts. I'll
come in and have a drink on the way back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Harry's out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Is he? I sent you a note this morning. I said I couldn't dine on
Thursday and I'd come and fetch Harry for a ride this afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I didn't tell him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> No?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I don't see you very often nowadays.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> There's an awful lot of work to do just now. They lead me a
dog's life at the legation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Even at night? At first you used to come and dine with us two or
three nights a week.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> I can't always be sponging on you. It's positively indecent.<a name="page_043" id="page_043"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> We don't know many people. It's not always very lively here. I
should have thought if you didn't care to come for my sake you'd have
come for Harry's.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> I come whenever you ask me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> You haven't been here for a month.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> It just happens that the last two or three times you've asked me
to dine I've been engaged.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Her voice breaking.</i>] You promised that we'd be friends. What
have I done to turn you against me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>His armour pierced by the emotion in her voice.</i>] Oh, Daisy,
don't speak like that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I've tried to do everything I could to please you. If there's
anything I do that you don't like, won't you tell me? I promise you I
won't do it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Oh, my dear child, you make me feel such an awful beast.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Is it the past that you can't forget?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Good heavens, no, what do I care about the past?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I have so few friends. I'm so awfully fond of you, George.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> I don't think I've given you much cause to be that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> There must be some reason why you won't ever come near me. Why
won't you tell me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Oh, it's absurd, you're making a mountain out of a molehill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> You used to be so jolly, and we used to laugh together. I looked
forward so much to your coming here. What has changed you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Nothing has changed me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>With a passion of despair.</i>] Oh, I might as well batter my head
against a brick wall. How can you be so unkind to me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> For God's sake ... [<i>He stops.</i>] Heaven knows, I don't want to
be unkind to you.<a name="page_044" id="page_044"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Then why do you treat me as an outcast? Oh, it's cruel, cruel.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">George</span> <i>is excessively distressed</i>. <i>He walks up and down, frowning.</i>
<i>He cannot bear to look at</i> <span class="smcap">Daisy</span> <i>and he speaks with hesitation</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> You'll think me an awful rotter, Daisy, but you can't think me
more of a rotter than I think myself. I don't know how to say it. It
seems such an awful thing to say. I'm so ashamed of myself. I don't
suppose two men have ever been greater pals than Harry and I. He's
married to you and he's awfully in love with you. And I think you're in
love with him. I was only twenty-three when I&mdash;first knew you. It's an
awful long time ago, isn't it? There are some wounds that never quite
heal, you know. Oh, my God, don't you understand? [<i>His embarrassment,
the distraction of his tone, and the way the halting words fall
unwillingly from his lips have betrayed the truth to</i> <span class="smcap">Daisy</span>. <i>She does
not speak, she does not stir, she looks at him with great shining eyes.
She hardly dares to breathe.</i>] If ever you wanted revenge on me you've
got it now. You must see that it's better that I shouldn't come here too
often. Forgive me&mdash;Goodby.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lee Tai.</span> [<i>With a chuckle.</i>] What will you tell him? Don't you be a
silly girl, Daisy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> What do you want?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lee Tai.</span> [<i>Coolly.</i>] You.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Don't you know that I loathe you? You disgust me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lee Tai.</span> What do I care? Perhaps if you loved me I shouldn't want you.
Your hatred is like a sharp and bitter sauce that tickles my appetite.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> You beast.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lee Tai.</span> I like the horror that makes your body tremble when I hold you
in my arms. And sometimes the horror turns on a sudden into a wild
tempest of passion.<a name="page_046" id="page_046"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> You liar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lee Tai.</span> Leave this stupid white man. What is he to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> He is my husband.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lee Tai.</span> It is a year to-day since you were married. What has marriage
done for you? You thought when you married a white man you'd become a
white woman. Do you think they can look at you and forget? How many
white women do you know? How many friends have you got? You're a
prisoner. I'll take you to Singapore or Calcutta. Don't you want to
amuse yourself? Do you want to go to Europe? I'll take you to Paris.
I'll give you more money to spend in a week than your husband earns in a
year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I'm very comfortable in Peking, thank you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lee Tai.</span> [<i>Snapping his fingers.</i>] You don't care that for your husband.
He loves you. You despise him. Don't you wish with all your heart that
you hadn't married him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amah.</span> He very silly white man. He no likee Daisy's old amah. Perhaps one
day he b'long sick. Daisy cry velly much if he die?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Impatiently.</i>] Don't be such a fool.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amah.</span> Perhaps one day he drink whisky soda. Oh, velly ill, velly ill.
What's the matter with me? No sabe. No can stand. Doctor no sabe. Then
die. Hi, hi.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> You silly old woman. Harry's not a Chinaman and he wouldn't call
in a Chinese doctor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lee Tai.</span> [<i>With a smile.</i>] China is a very old and a highly civilized
country, Daisy. When anyone is in your way, it's not very difficult to
get rid of him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Scornfully.</i>] And do you think I'd let poor Harry be murdered
so that I might be free to listen to your generous proposals? You must
think I'm a fool if you expect me to risk my neck for that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lee Tai.</span> You don't take <i>any</i> risk, Daisy. You know nothing.<a name="page_047" id="page_047"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amah.</span> Lee Tai velly clever man, Daisy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I thought so once. Lee Tai, you're a damned fool. Get out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lee Tai.</span> Freedom is a very good thing, Daisy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> What should I do with it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lee Tai.</span> Wouldn't you like to be free now? [<i>She looks at him sharply.
She wonders if it can possibly be that he suspects her passion for
George Conway. He meets her glance steadily.</i>] One day Sen Shi Ming was
sitting with his wife looking at a Tang bronze that he had just bought
when he heard someone in the street crying for help. Sen Shi was a very
brave man and he snatched up a revolver and ran out. Sen Shi forgot that
he had cheated his brother out of a house in Hatamen Street or he would
have been more prudent. Sen Shi was found by the watchman an hour later
with a dagger in his heart. Who killed cock-robin?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amah.</span> Hi, hi. Sen Shi velly silly man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lee Tai.</span> His brother knew that. They had grown up together. If I heard
cries for help outside my house late in the night, I should ask myself
who had a grudge against me, and I should make sure the door was bolted.
But white men are very brave. White men don't know the Chinese customs.
Would you be very sorry if an accident happened to your excellent
husband?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I wonder what you take me for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lee Tai.</span> Why do you pretend to me, Daisy? Do you think I don't know you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> The door is a little on the left of you, Lee Tai. Would you give
yourself the trouble of walking through it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lee Tai.</span> [<i>With a smile.</i>] I go, but I come back. Perhaps you'll change
your mind.</p>

<p>[<i>He ties up his bundle and is about to go.</i> <span class="smcap">Harry</span> <i>enters</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Oh, Harry, you're back very soon!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Yes, the pony went lame. Fortunately I hadn't gone far before I
noticed it. Who's this?<a name="page_048" id="page_048"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> It's a curio-dealer. He has nothing I want. I was just sending
him away.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Lee Tai</span> <i>takes up his bundle and goes out</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> [<i>Noticing the orchids.</i>] Someone been sending you flowers?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> George.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Rather nice of him. [<i>To the</i> <span class="smcap">Amah</span>.] Run along, amah, I want to
talk to missy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amah.</span> All light.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> And don't let me catch you listening round the corner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amah.</span> My no listen. What for I listen?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Run along&mdash;chop-chop.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amah.</span> Can do. [<i>She goes out.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> [<i>With a laugh.</i>] I couldn't give you a greater proof of my
affection than consenting to have that old woman around all the time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I don't know why you dislike her. She's devoted to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> That's the only reason I put up with her. She gives me the
creeps. I have the impression that she watches every movement I make.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Oh, what nonsense!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> And I've caught her eavesdropping.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Was it amah that you wanted to talk to me about?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> No, I've got something to tell you. How would you like to leave
Peking?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>With a start, suddenly off her guard.</i>] Not at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> I'm afraid it's awfully dull for you here, darling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I don't find it so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> You're so dear and sweet. Are you sure you don't say that on my
account?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I'm very fond of Peking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> We've been married a year now. I don't<a name="page_049" id="page_049"></a> want to hurt your
feelings, darling, but it's no good beating about the bush, and I think
it's better to be frank.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Surely you can say anything you like to me without hesitation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Things have been a little awkward in a way. The women I used to
know before we married left cards on you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Having taken the precaution to discover that I should be out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> And you returned those cards and that was the end of it. I asked
George what he thought about my taking you to the club to play tennis
and he said he thought we'd better not risk it. The result is that you
don't know a soul.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Have I complained?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> You've been most awfully decent about it, but I hate to think of
your spending day after day entirely by yourself. It can't be good for
you to be so much alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I might have known Mrs. Chuan. She's a white woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Oh, my dear, she was&mdash;heaven knows what she was! She's married to
a Chinaman. It's horrible. She's outside the pale.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> And there's Bertha Raymond. She's very nice, even though she is a
Eurasian.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> I'm sure she's very nice, but we couldn't very well have the
Raymonds here and refuse to go to them. Her brother is one of the clerks
in my office. I don't want to seem an awful snob....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> You needn't hesitate to say anything about the Eurasians. You
can't hate and despise them more than I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> I don't hate and despise them. I think that's odious. But
sometimes they're not very tactful. I don't know that I much want one of
my clerks to come and slap me on the back in the office and call me old
chap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Of course not.<a name="page_050" id="page_050"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> The fact is we've been trying to do an impossible thing. It's no
good kicking against the pricks. What with the legations and one thing
and another Peking's hopeless. We'd far better clear out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> But if I don't mind why should you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Well, it's not very nice for me either. It's for my sake just as
much as for yours that I'd be glad to go elsewhere. Of course everybody
at the club knows I'm married. Some of them ignore it altogether. I
don't mind that so much. Some of them ask after you with an exaggerated
cordiality which is rather offensive. And every now and then some fool
begins to slang the Eurasians and everybody kicks him under the table.
Then he remembers about me and goes scarlet. By God, it's hell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Sulkily.</i>] I don't want to leave Peking. I'm very happy here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Well, darling, I've applied for a transfer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>With sudden indignation.</i>] Without saying a word to me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> I thought you'd be glad. I didn't want to say anything till it
was settled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Do you think I am a child to have everything arranged for me
without a word? [<i>Trying to control herself.</i>] After all, you'd never
see George. Surely you don't want to lose sight of your only real
friend.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> I've talked it over with George and he thinks it's the best thing
to do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Did he advise you to go?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Strongly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Violently.</i>] I won't do it. I won't leave Peking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Why should his advice make the difference?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Why? [<i>She is confused for a moment, but quickly recovers
herself.</i>] I won't let George Conway&mdash;or anybody else&mdash;decide where I'm
to go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Don't be unreasonable, darling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I won't go. I tell you I won't go.<a name="page_051" id="page_051"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Well, I'm afraid you must now. It's all settled. The transfer is
decided.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Bursting into tears.</i>] Oh, Harry, don't take me away from here.
I can't bear it. I want to stay here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Oh, darling, how can you be so silly! You'll have a much better
time at one of the outports. You see, there are so few white people
there that they can't afford to put on frills. They'll be jolly glad to
know us both. We shall lead a normal life and be like everybody else.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Sulkily.</i>] Where do you want to go?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> I've been put in charge of our place at Chung-king.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Starting up with a cry.</i>] Chung-king! Of course you'd choose
Chung-king.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Why, what's wrong with it? Do you know it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> No&mdash;oh, what am I talking about? I'm all confused. Yes, I was
there once when I was a girl. It's a hateful place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Oh, nonsense! The consul's got a charming wife, and there are
quite a nice lot of people there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Distracted.</i>] Oh, what shall I do? I'm so unhappy. If you cared
for me at all you wouldn't treat me so cruelly. You're ashamed of me.
You want to hide me. Why should I bury myself in a hole two thousand
miles up the river? I won't go! I won't go! I won't go! [<i>She bursts
into a storm of hysterical weeping.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> [<i>Trying to take her in his arms.</i>] Oh, Daisy, for God's sake
don't cry. You know I'm not ashamed of you. I love you more than ever. I
love you with all my heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Drawing away from him.</i>] Don't touch me. Leave me alone. I hate
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Don't say that, Daisy. It hurts me frightfully.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Oh, go away, go away!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> [<i>Seeking to reason with her.</i>] I can't leave you like this.<a name="page_052" id="page_052"></a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang"><i>The sitting-room in the</i> <span class="smcap">Andersons'</span> <i>apartments. At the back are
two double doors. The lower part of them is solid, but above they
are cut in an intricate trellis. The ceiling is raftered, painted
red and decorated with dim, gold dragons; the walls are
whitewashed. On them hang Chinese pictures on rolls. Between the
doors is a little image of the domestic god, and under it a tiny
oil lamp is burning. The furniture is partly Chinese and partly
European. There is an English writing-table, but the occasional
tables, richly carved, are Chinese. There is a Chinese pallet-bed,
covered with bamboo matting, and there is an English Chesterfield.
There are a couple of Philippine rattan chairs and one or two of
Cantonese blackwood. On the floor is a Chinese carpet. A Ming tile
here and there gives a vivid note of colour. It is a summer night
and the doors are wide open. Through them you see one of the
courtyards of the temple</i>.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Amah</span> <i>is seated in one of the blackwood chairs by the side of

herself again and lights her pipe. She smokes quietly</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amah.</span> I baptized one, two, three, four, five times. I velly Christian

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Why not? Surely Miss Knox must want to see the principal sights
of Peking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> The man is not a raving lunatic, Sylvia. His only delusion is that
he's a humourist ... Sylvia thought she'd like to call on Mrs. Harry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> I'm sure Daisy will be very glad. Amah, go and tell Missy that
there's a lady.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amah.</span> Can do.</p>

<p>[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> I say, have they caught any of those blighters who tried to kill
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> No, not a chance. They weren't after me, you know; they were
after Harry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> Is there anyone who has a grudge against him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> I don't think so. He doesn't seem very keen on discussing the
incident.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Daisy</span> <i>comes in</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> Here she is. I've brought my sister to see you, Mrs. Harry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Shaking hands.</i>] How do you do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> What a wonderful place you live in!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> It's rather attractive, isn't it? You must see the temple before
you go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> I'd love to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Do sit down. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Knox</span>.] What do you think of my patient?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> I think he's a fraud. I never saw anyone look so robust.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Delighted.</i>] He's made a wonderful recovery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Thanks to you, Daisy. You can't think how she nursed me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> It was rather a narrow escape, wasn't it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> For two days we thought he might die at any minute. It was&mdash;it
was rather dreadful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> And do you know, all that time she never left me a minute. [<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Daisy</span>.] I don't know how I can ever thank you.<a name="page_085" id="page_085"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Oh, well, Harry had his work. I didn't think he ought to be
robbed of his night's rest for a worthless creature like you, and I
hated the idea of a paid nurse looking after you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> You must have been worn out at the end of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> No, I'm as strong as a horse. And it was such a relief to me when
the doctor said he was out of danger, I forgot I was tired.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> I don't know why you bothered about him. There are such a lot of
fellows who want his job and they all know they could do it much better
than he can.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Everyone's been so extraordinarily good to me. I had no idea
there was so much kindness in the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>, <i>very pleasantly</i>.] Will you come and look at the
temple now while they're bringing tea?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> Yes, I'd like to very much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I think you'll enjoy your tea more if you feel you've done the
sight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> It's all so new to me. Everything interests me. I've fallen
passionately in love with Peking.</p>

<p>[<i>They wander off, talking gaily.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Harold, you're a very nice boy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> That's what the girls tell me. But I don't know why you should.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> I think it was rather sporting of you to bring your sister to
see Daisy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> I don't deserve any credit for that. She insisted on coming.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Oh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> She met Harry at the club and took rather a fancy to him. When I
told her Daisy was a half-caste and people didn't bother much about her
she got right up on her hind legs. I told her she'd only just come out
to China and didn't know what she was talking about and then she gave me
what she called a bit of her mind. I was obliged to remark that if that
was a bit I didn't much care about knowing the rest.<a name="page_086" id="page_086"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> It sounds as though you'd had a little tiff.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> She said she had no patience with the airs people gave themselves
in the East. A Eurasian was just as good as anybody else. And when I
happened to say I was coming here to-day to see how you were she said
she'd come too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> It's very kind of her. Daisy leads a dreadfully lonely life. It
would mean so much to her if she knew one or two white women. If they
take to one another, you won't try to crab it, will you? I fancy Daisy
wants a friend rather badly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> I shouldn't like it very much, you know. Would you much care for
your sister to be very pally with a half-caste?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Daisy is one in a thousand. You can't think what she's done for
me during my illness. My mother couldn't have taken more care of me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> They're often very good-hearted. But as a matter of fact nothing I
can say will have the least effect on Sylvia. Girls have changed a lot
since the war. If she wants to do a thing and she thinks it right,
she'll do it. And if I try to interfere she's quite capable of telling
me to go to the devil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> She seems to be a young woman of some character.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> Perhaps because she's had rather a rough time. The fellow she was
engaged to was killed in the war and she was awfully cut up. She drove
an ambulance for the last two years and then she went up to Girton.
After that my father thought she'd better come out here for a bit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> She ought to like it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> If she doesn't put up people's backs too much. She can't stand
anything like injustice or cruelty. If she thinks people are unkind to
Daisy or sniffy about her, she'll stick to her like a leech. However, I
daresay she'll get married.<a name="page_087" id="page_087"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>Smiling.</i>] That'll learn her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> Why don't you marry her? It's about time you settled down.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>With a chuckle.</i>] You fool.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> Why? You're by way of being rather eligible, aren't you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> I don't know why you want to get rid of her. She seems a very
nice sister.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> Of course I love having her with me, but she does cramp my style a
bit. And she ought to marry. She'd make you a first-rate wife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Much too good for the likes of me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> Of course she's a bit independent, but one has to put up with that
in girls nowadays. And she's as good as gold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> One can see that at a mile, my son.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> I say, who was Rathbone, Daisy's first husband, do you know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>His face a blank.</i>] Harry told me he was an American. He said
he was in business in the F. M. S.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> That's what Harry told me. I met a fellow the other day who lives
in Singapore who told me he'd never heard of Rathbone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>Chaffing him.</i>] Perhaps he didn't move in the exalted circles
that a friend of yours would naturally move in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> I suppose there was a Mr. Rathbone?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">[<i>There is a distant sound in the street of Chinese instruments

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> It's a Manchu wedding. The amah was talking about it this

are followed by two or three youths on horseback, gorgeously

painted and gilt, of the bride. Then pass more priests and another
band and finally a last string of retainers in red. When the last
one has disappeared a beggar shows himself at the open doorway. He

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I know who you mean.</p>

makes my blood boil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Oh, how?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> Well, you know that her husband's a drunken brute who's treated
her abominably for years. At last she fell in love with a man and now
her husband is going to divorce her. It's monstrous that he should be
able to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Are the ladies of Peking giving her the cold shoulder?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox.</span> The cold <i>shoulder</i> hardly describes it. The frozen silverside.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> I think she's well rid of Reggie Stopfort at any price, but I'm
sorry the other party is André Leroux.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> Why? She introduced me to him. I thought he was a very nice
fellow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Well, you see, if he'd been English or American, he would have
married her as a matter of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> So I should hope.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Because she was divorced on his account, you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Yes. But the French haven't our feeling on<a name="page_090" id="page_090"></a> that matter. I'm not
quite sure if André will be willing to marry her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> Oh, that would be dreadful! Under those circumstances the man
must marry the woman. He simply must.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Don't you think she's pretty?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Yes, very. But you're so much more than pretty. I expect you
have more brains in your little finger than she has in her whole body.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Gravely.</i>] She has something that I haven't got, George, and
I'd give my soul to have.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>Embarrassed.</i>] I don't know what you<a name="page_091" id="page_091"></a> mean. [<i>Changing the
conversation abruptly.</i>] Daisy, now that I'm going away....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Interrupting.</i>] Are you really going to-morrow?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>Breezily.</i>] I'm quite well. I'm ashamed to have stayed so
long.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I don't look forward very much to the long, empty days when
you're no longer here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>Seriously.</i>] I must go, Daisy. I really must.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>After a moment's pause.</i>] What were you going to say to me?
Don't thank me for anything I may have done. It's given me a happiness I
never knew before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Except for you I should have died. And when I think of the past
I am ashamed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> What does the past matter? The past is dead and gone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> And I'm ashamed when I think how patient you were when I was
irritable, how kind and thoughtful. I hardly knew I wanted a thing
before you gave it to me. Sometimes when I felt I couldn't breathe, the
tenderness of your hand on my forehead&mdash;oh, it was like a dip in a
highland stream on a summer day. I think I never knew that there was in
you the most precious thing that anyone can have, goodness. Oh, Daisy,
it makes me feel so humble.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Goodness? [<i>With the shadow of a laugh.</i>] Oh, George.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> It's because Harry is better and simpler than I am that he was
able to see it in you. He felt it in you always and he was right.</p>

<p>[<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Amah</span> <i>comes in</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Sharply.</i>] What d'you want?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">[<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Amah</span> <i>crosses from one to the other and a thin smile crosses
her eyes</i>.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Amah.</span> Master telephone, Daisy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Why didn't you take the message?</p>

<p>[<i>She is about to go into the house.</i><a name="page_092" id="page_092"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amah.</span> He have go now. He say very much hurry. I say no can findee you. I
think you go out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Why did you say that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amah.</span> I think more better, maybe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>Smiling.</i>] That's right, amah. Never tell the truth when a lie
will do as well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Well, what was the message?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amah.</span> Master say he must to go Tientsin. Very important business. No
come back to-night. Come back first train to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Very well. Tell the boy that we shall be only two to dinner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amah.</span> I go talkee he.</p>

<p>[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>Urbanely.</i>] I say, I don't want to be an awful trouble to you.
I think I'd better go back to my own place to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Looking at him.</i>] Why should you do that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> I was going to-morrow anyway.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Do you think my reputation is such a sensitive flower?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>Lightly.</i>] Of course not. But people aren't very charitable.
It seems rather funny I should stay here when Harry's away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> What do you suppose I care if people gossip?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> I care for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>With a smile, almost archly.</i>] It's not very flattering to me
that you should insist on going the moment Harry does. Do I bore you so
much as all that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>With a chuckle.</i>] How can you talk such nonsense? I haven't
wanted to get well too quickly. I've so enjoyed sitting quietly here
while you read or sewed. I've got so much in the habit of seeing you
about me that if I don't go at once I shall never be able to bring
myself to go at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Since that horrible accident I've been rather<a name="page_093" id="page_093"></a> nervous at the
thought of sleeping here by myself. I'm terrified at the thought of
being left alone to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Come in with me, then. The Knoxes will be delighted to put you
up for the night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>With a sudden change of manner.</i>] I don't want you to go,
George. I want you to stay.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>As serious as she is.</i>] Daisy, don't be too hard on me. You
don't know. You don't know. [<i>With an effort he regains his self-control
and returns to his easy, chaffing tone.</i>] Don't forget it's not only a
wound in the lung that I've been suffering from. While you and the
doctor between you have been patching that up, I've been busy sticking
together the pieces of a broken heart. It's nicely set now, no one could
tell that there'd ever been anything wrong with it, but I don't think it
would be very wise to give it a sudden jolt or jerk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>In a low quivering voice.</i>] Why do you say things like that?
What is the good of making pretences?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>Determined to keep the note of lightness.</i>] It was very silly
of me to bother you with my little troubles. It was very hot. I was
overworked and nervous at the time or I shouldn't have made so much of
it. I'm sure that you'll be as pleased as I am to know that I'm making a
very good recovery, thank you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>As though asking a casual question.</i>] You don't care for me any
more?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> I have the greatest affection for you. I admire you and of
course I'm grateful to you. But if I thought I was in love with you I
was mistaken.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Do you know why I wouldn't have a professional nurse and when you
were unconscious for two days refused to leave you for a minute? Do you
know why, afterwards, at night when you grew delirious I wouldn't let
Harry watch you? I said it would interfere with his work. I dared not
leave you for a single moment. And it was your secret and mine. I
wouldn't let anybody in<a name="page_094" id="page_094"></a> the world share it with me. Do you know what
you said in your delirium?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>Disturbed.</i>] I expect I talked an awful lot of rot. People
always do, I believe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Passionately.</i>] You used to call me, "Daisy, Daisy," as though
your heart was breaking. And when I leaned over you and said: "I'm
here," you would take my face in your hands so that I could hardly
believe you weren't conscious. And you said: "I love you."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Oh, God!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> And sometimes I didn't know how to calm you. You were frantic
because you thought they were taking me away from you. "I can't bear
it," you said, "I shall die." I had to put my hands over your mouth so
that no one should hear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> I didn't know what I was saying. I wasn't myself. It was just
the madness of the fever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> And sometimes you were so exquisitely tender. Your voice was soft
and caressing. And you called me by sweet names so that the tears ran
down my cheeks. You thought you held me in your arms and you pressed me
to your heart. You were happy then; you were so happy that I was afraid
you'd die of it. I know what love is and you love me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> For God's sake, stop. Why do you torture me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> And then you were madly jealous. You hated Harry. I think you
could have killed him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> That's not true. That's infamous. Never. Never.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Oh, you can say that with your lips! Sometimes you thought he put
his arms round me and kissed me and you sobbed aloud. Oh, it was so
painful. I forgot that you were unconscious and I took your hands and
said: "He's not here. You and I are alone, alone, alone." And sometimes
I think you understood. You fell back. And a look of peace came on your
face as if you were in heaven<a name="page_095" id="page_095"></a> and you said&mdash;do you know what you said?
You said: "Beloved, beloved, beloved."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">[<i>Her voice breaks and the tears course down her cheeks.</i> <span class="smcap">George</span>
<i>is shattered by what she has told him</i>.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> I suppose there are few of us that wouldn't turn away from
ourselves in horror if the innermost thoughts of our heart, the thoughts
we're only conscious of to hate, were laid bare. But that shameful thing
that showed itself in me isn't me. I disown it....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I thought you had more courage. I thought you had more sense. Do
you call that you, a few conventional prejudices? The real you is the
love that consumes you more hotly than ever the fever did. The only you
is the you that loves me. The rest is only frills. It's a domino that
you put on at a masked ball.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> You don't know what you say. Frills? It's honour, and duty, and
decency. It's everything that makes it possible for me to cling to the
shadow of my self-respect.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Oh, all that means nothing. You fool. You might as well try with
your bare hands to stop the flow of the Yangtze.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> If I perish I perish. Oh, of course I love you. All night I'm
tortured with love and tortured with jealousy, but the day does come at
last and then I can get hold of myself again. My love is some horrible
thing gnawing at my heart-strings. I hate it and despise it. But I can
fight it, fight it all the time. Oh, I've been here too long. I ought to
have got back to work long ago. Work is my only chance. Daisy, I beseech
you to let me go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> How can I let you go? I love you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>Thunderstruck.</i>] You? [<i>Impatiently, with a shrug of the
shoulders.</i>] Oh, you're talking nonsense.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Why do you suppose I've said all these things? Do you think a
woman cares twopence for a man's love when she doesn't love him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Oh, it's impossible. You don't know what<a name="page_096" id="page_096"></a> you're saying. I know
how good and kind you are. You've been touched by my love. You mistake
pity for love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I'm not good and I'm not kind. There's no room in my soul for
pity. In my soul there's only a raging hunger. If I know what you feel
it's because I feel it too. I love you, I love you, I love you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> And Harry?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> What do I care about Harry? I hate him because he's stood between
me and you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> He is your husband. He is my friend.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> He doesn't exist. I've loved you always from the first day I saw
you. The others were nothing to me, Lee Tai and Harry and the rest. I've
loved you always. I've never loved anyone but you. All these years I've
kept the letters you wrote to me. I've read them till I know every word
by heart. They're all blurred and smudged with the tears I've wept over
them. They were all I had. Do you think I'm going to let you go now? All
my pain, all my anguish, are nothing any more. I love you and you love
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Oh, don't, don't!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> You can't leave me now. If you leave me I shall kill myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> I must go away. I must never see you again. Whatever happens we
must never meet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Exasperated and impatient.</i>] That's impossible. What will you
say to Harry?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> If need be I'll tell him the truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> What difference will that make? Will you love me any the less?
Yes, tell him. Tell him that I love you and you only and that I belong
to you and to you only.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Oh, Daisy, for God's sake try and control yourself. We must do
our duty, we must, we must.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I know no duty. I only know love. There's no room in my soul for
anything else. You say that love is like a wild beast gnawing at your
entrails. My love is<a name="page_097" id="page_097"></a> a liberator. It's freed me from a hateful past.
It's freed me from Harry. There's nothing in the world now but you and
me and the love that joins us. I want you, I want you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Don't, don't! Oh, this is madness! There's only one thing to be
done. God, give me strength. Daisy, you know I love you. I love you with
all my heart and soul. But it's good-bye. I'll never see you again.
Never. Never. So help me God.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> How can you be so cruel? You're heartless. I've wanted you all
these years. I've hungered for you. You don't know what my humiliation
has been. Pity me because I loved you. If you leave me now I shall die.
You open the doors of heaven to me and then you slam them in my face.
Haven't you made me unhappy enough? You'd have done better to kill me
ten years ago. You trampled me in the mud and then you left me. Oh, what
shall I do? [<i>She sinks down to the ground, weeping as though her heart
would break.</i> <span class="smcap">George</span> <i>looks at her for a minute, his face distorted with

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Open the door, you old silly. [<i>She begins to blow up the balloon
again. The</i> <span class="smcap">Amah</span> <i>goes to the door and opens it</i>. <span class="smcap">Lee Tai</span> <i>steps in</i>.]
Lee Tai. Send these away. [<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Amah</span> <i>makes a sign to the old Chinaman,
he gives each child a hand and with their presents they go out. The</i>
<span class="smcap">Amah</span> <i>slips out after them</i>.] I thought you were dead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lee Tai.</span> I'm very much alive, thank you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Ah, well, we'll hope for the best.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lee Tai.</span> I trust you're not displeased to see me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Gaily.</i>] If you'd come yesterday I should certainly have
smacked your face, but to-day I'm in such a good humour that even the
sight of you is tolerable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lee Tai.</span> You weren't here yesterday.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">[<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Amah</span> <i>comes in carrying on a little wooden tray, two Chinese
bowls and a tea-pot</i>.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> My dear Mamma seems to think you've come to pay me a visit. You
mustn't let me keep you too long.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lee Tai.</span> You are expecting someone? I know.</p>

<p>[<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Amah</span> <i>goes out</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Chaffing him.</i>] I always said you had a brain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lee Tai.</span> No better a one than yours, Daisy. It was a clever trick when
you got me to try to put your husband out of the way so that you should
be free for George Conway.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> It was nothing to do with me. I told you I'd have nothing to do
with it. You made a hash of it. One can forgive the good for being
stupid, but when rascals are fools there's no excuse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lee Tai.</span> The best laid schemes of mice and men, as my favourite poet
Robert Burns so elegantly puts it, gang aft agley.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I don't care a damn about your favourite poet. What have you come
here for to-day?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lee Tai.</span> As it turns out I do not see that there is any<a name="page_105" id="page_105"></a> cause for
regret that George Conway got the knife thrust that was intended for
your husband. I wish it had gone a little deeper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Coolly.</i>] As it turns out you only did me a service. But still
you haven't told me to what I owe the honour of your visit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lee Tai.</span> Civility. I like to be on friendly terms with my tenants.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Surprised.</i>] Your what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lee Tai.</span> [<i>Urbanely.</i>] This happens to be my house. When I discovered
that your honourable mother had taken the rooms in this courtyard so
that you might have a place where George Conway and you could safely
meet I thought I would buy the whole house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I hope it was a good investment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lee Tai.</span> Otherwise perhaps I should have hesitated. It was clever of you
to find so convenient a place. With a curio shop in front into which
anyone can be seen going without remark and an ill-lit passage leading
to this court, it is perfect.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> What is the idea?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lee Tai.</span> [<i>With a twinkle in his eyes.</i>] Are you a little frightened?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Not a bit. What can you do? You can tell Harry. Tell him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lee Tai.</span> [<i>Affably.</i>] George Conway would be ruined.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>With a shrug.</i>] He'd lose his job. Perhaps you would give him
another. You're mixed up in so many concerns you could surely find use
for a white man who speaks Chinese as well as George does.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lee Tai.</span> I find even your shamelessness attractive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I'm profoundly grateful for the compliment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lee Tai.</span> But do not fear. I shall do nothing. I bought this house
because I like you to know that always, always you are in my hand. Where
you go, I go. Where you are, I am. Sometimes you do not see me, but
nevertheless I am close. I do nothing. I am content to wait.<a name="page_106" id="page_106"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Your time is your own. I have no objection to your wasting it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lee Tai.</span> One day, and I think that day is not very far distant, you will
come to me. I was the first and I shall be the last. If you like I will
marry you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>With a smile.</i>] I thought you had two, if not three, wives
already. I fancy that number four would have rather a thin time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lee Tai.</span> My wife can be divorced. I am willing to marry you before the
British Consul. We will go to Penang. I have a house there. You shall
have motor cars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> It's astonishing how easy it is to resist temptations that don't
tempt you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lee Tai.</span> Sneer. What do I care? I wait.... What have you to do with
white men? You are not a white woman. What power has this blood of your
father's when it is mingled with the tumultuous stream which you have
inherited through your mother from innumerable generations? Our race is
very pure and very strong. Strange nations have overrun us, but in a
little while we have absorbed them so that no trace of a foreign people
is left in us. China is like the Yangtze, which is fed by five hundred
streams and yet remains unchanged, the river of golden sand, majestic,
turbulent, indifferent, and everlasting. What power have you to swim
against that mighty current? You can wear European clothes and eat
European food, but in your heart you are a Chinawoman. Are your passions
the weak and vacillating passions of the white man? There is in your
heart a simplicity which the white man can never fathom and a
deviousness which he can never understand. Your soul is like a rice
patch cleared in the middle of the jungle. All around the jungle hovers,
watchful and jealous, and it is only by ceaseless labour that you can
prevent its inroads. One day your labour will be vain and the jungle
will take back its own. China is closing in on you.<a name="page_107" id="page_107"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> My poor Lee Tai, you're talking perfect nonsense.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lee Tai.</span> You're restless and unhappy and dissatisfied because you're
struggling against instincts which were implanted in your breast when
the white man was a hungry, naked savage. One day you will surrender.
You will cast off the white woman like an outworn garment. You will come
back to China as a tired child comes back to his mother. And in the
immemorial usages of our great race you will find peace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> George Conway loves me, and I&mdash; Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lee Tai.</span> The white man's love lasts no longer than a summer day. It is a
red, red rose. Now it flaunts its scented beauty proudly in the sun and
to-morrow its petals, wrinkled and stinking, lie scattered on the
ground.</p>

<p>[<i>There is a sound of a footstep in the courtyard outside.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Here he is. Go quickly.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">[<span class="smcap">George</span> <i>opens the door and stops as he catches sight of</i> <span class="smcap">Lee Tai</span>.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Hulloa, who's this?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">[<span class="smcap">Lee Tai</span> <i>steps forward, smiling and obsequious</i>.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Lee Tai.</span> I am the owner of this house. The amah complained that the roof
leaked and I came to see for myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>Frowning.</i>] It's of no consequence. Please don't bother about
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lee Tai.</span> I wish I needn't. The amah has a virulent and active tongue&mdash;I
am afraid she will give me no peace till I have satisfied her outrageous
demands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> You speak extraordinarily good English.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lee Tai.</span> I am a graduate of the University of Edinburgh.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Robert Burns is his favourite poet.<a name="page_108" id="page_108"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lee Tai.</span> I spent a year at Oxford and another at Harvard. I can express
myself in English not without fluency.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Let me compliment you on your good sense in retaining your
national costume. I think it a pity that the returned students should
insist on wearing ugly tweed suits and billycock hats.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lee Tai.</span> I spent eight years abroad. I brought back with me no more
admiration for Western dress than for Western civilization.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> That is very interesting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lee Tai.</span> You are pleased to be sarcastic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> And you, I think, are somewhat supercilious. Believe me, the
time has passed when the mandarins of your country, in their
impenetrable self-conceit, could put up a barrier against the advance of
civilization. If you have any love for China you must see that her only
chance to take her rightful place in the world is to accept honestly and
sincerely the teaching of the West.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lee Tai.</span> And if in our hearts we despise and detest what you have to
teach us? For what reason are you so confident that you are so superior
to us that it behooves us to sit humbly at your feet? Have you excelled
us in arts or letters? Have our thinkers been less profound than yours?
Has our civilization been less elaborate, less complicated, less refined
than yours? Why, when you lived in caves and clothed yourselves with
skins we were a cultured people. Do you know that we tried an experiment
which is unique in the world?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>Good-naturedly.</i>] What experiment is that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lee Tai.</span> We sought to rule this great people not by force, but by
wisdom. And for centuries we succeeded. Then why does the white man
despise the yellow? Shall I tell you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lee Tai.</span> [<i>With a smiling contempt.</i>] Because he has invented the
machine-gun. That is your superiority.<a name="page_109" id="page_109"></a> We are a defenceless horde and
you can blow us into eternity. [<i>With a tinge of sadness.</i>] You have
shattered the dream of our philosophers that the world could be governed
by the power of law and order.... And now you are teaching our young men
your secret. You have thrust your hideous inventions upon us. Fools. Do
you not know that we have a genius for mechanics? Do you not know that
there are in this country four hundred millions of the most practical
and industrious people in the world? Do you think it will take us long
to learn? And what will become of your superiority when the yellow man
can make as good guns as the white and fire them as straight? You have
appealed to the machine-gun and by the machine-gun shall you be judged.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> What is your name?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lee Tai.</span> [<i>With a thin, amused smile.</i>] Lee Tai Cheng.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>With a frigid politeness.</i>] I'm sure you are very busy, Mr.

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> What the devil is he doing here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Amused.</i>] He came to make me an offer of marriage. I pointed
out to him that I was married already.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>Not without irritation.</i>] How did he know you were here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> He made it his business to find out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Does he know that...?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Coolly.</i>] You know China better than most Englishmen. You know
that the white man can do nothing without the Chinese knowing it. But
they won't tell other white men unless&mdash;unless it's to their advantage
to do so.<a name="page_110" id="page_110"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> You told me that this house belonged to the amah.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Smiling.</i>] That was a slight exaggeration.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> You put it very mildly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> You said you wouldn't come to the temple. It meant finding some
place where we could meet or never seeing you at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>Sombrely.</i>] We began with deceit and with deceit we've
continued.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Tenderly.</i>] There's no deceit in my love, George. After all,
our love is the only thing that matters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>With a certain awkwardness.</i>] I'm afraid I've kept you
waiting. André Leroux came to see me just as I was leaving the Legation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Remembering.</i>] I know. Mrs. Stopfort's young man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> He said he knew Mrs. Stopfort's friends were rather anxious
about her future and he wanted them to know that he was going to marry
her as soon as she was free.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Of course it's the only decent thing to do, but I wasn't sure if
he'd see it. He's a very good fellow. [<i>With a smile.</i>] He spent at
least half an hour telling me how he adored Mrs. Stopfort.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Good-humouredly.</i>] Oh, you know I'm not the sort of woman to
grouse because you're a little late. I can always occupy myself by
thinking how wonderful it will be to see you. And if I get bored with
that I read your letters again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> I shouldn't have thought they were worth that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I think I have every word you have ever written to me&mdash;those old
letters of ten years ago and the little notes you write to me now. Even
though they're only two or three lines, saying you'll come here or can't
come, they're precious to me.<a name="page_111" id="page_111"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> But do you keep them here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Yes, they're safe here. They're locked up in that box. Only amah
has the key of this room ... George.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Will you do something for me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> If I can.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Will you dine here to-night? Amah will get us a lovely little
dinner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Oh, my dear, I can't! I've got an official dinner that I can't
possibly get out of.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Oh, how rotten!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> But I thought Harry was coming back this morning. He's been gone
a week already.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I had a letter saying he had to go on to Kalgan. But don't say
anything about it. He told me I was to keep it a secret.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> He must hate having to be away so much as he's been lately. The
death of that man Gregson has upset things rather.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Smiling.</i>] I wish I could thank Gregson for the good turn he
did <i>us</i> by dying at the psychological moment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>Dryly.</i>] I don't suppose that was his intention.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Except for that Harry would have insisted on going to Chung-king.
Now there's no possibility of that for at least a year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> I suppose not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> We've got a year before us, George, a whole year. And in a year
anything can happen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>Gravely.</i>] Do you never have any feeling that we've behaved
rottenly to Harry?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I? I've been happy for the first time in my life. At last I've
known peace and rest. Oh, George, I'm so grateful for all you've given
me! In these three months you've changed the whole world for me. I
thought I<a name="page_112" id="page_112"></a> couldn't love you more than I did. I think every day my love
grows more consuming.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>With a sigh.</i>] I've never known a single moment's happiness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> That's not true. When I've held you in my arms I've looked into
your eyes and I've seen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Oh, I know. There've been moments of madness in which I forgot
everything but that I loved you. I'm a low rotten cad. No one could
despise me more than I despise myself. I've loved you so that there was
room for nothing else in my soul. Waking and sleeping you've obsessed
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> That's how I want you to love me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> And I've hated myself for loving you. I've hated you for making
me love you. I've struggled with all my might and a hundred times I
thought I'd conquered myself and then the touch of your hand, the
softness of your lips&mdash;I was like a bird in a cage, I beat myself
against the bars and all the time the door was open and I hadn't the
will to fly out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Tenderly.</i>] Oh, darling, why do you make yourself unhappy when
happiness lies in the hollow of your hand?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Have you never regretted anything?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Never.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> You're stronger than I am. I'm as weak as dishwater. It's funny
that it should have taken me all these years to find it out. I was weak
from the beginning. But I was weakest of all that day. I was distracted,
I thought you were dying, I forgot everything except that I loved you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>With passion.</i>] Oh, my sweetheart! Don't you remember how, late
in the night, we went outside the temple and looked at the moonlight on
the walls of the Forbidden City? You had no regrets then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>Going on with his own thoughts.</i>] And afterwards your tears,
your happiness, the dread of giving you<a name="page_113" id="page_113"></a> pain and the hot love that
burnt me&mdash;I was in the toils then. I too knew a happiness that I had
never known before. On one side was honesty and duty and everything that
makes a man respect himself&mdash;and on the other was love. I thought you'd
be going away in two or three weeks and that would be the end of it. Oh,
it was no excuse&mdash;there are no excuses for me, I can never look Harry in
the face again, but though my heart was breaking at the thought, I&mdash;I
knew that in a few days I should see you for the last time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Scornfully.</i>] Do you think I'd have gone then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> And then came that sudden, unexpected, disastrous change in all
Harry's plans. And this house and all the sordid horror of an intrigue.
And then there was nothing to do but face the fact that I was a cur. I
wouldn't wish my worst enemy the torture that I've undergone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Full of love and pity.</i>] Oh, my darling, you know I'd do
anything in the world to give you happiness!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>Sombrely looking away from her.</i>] Daisy, I think you can never
give me happiness, but you can help me, not to make amends because
that's impossible, but to ... [<i>Impulsively, looking at her now.</i>] Oh,
Daisy, do you really love me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> With all my heart. With all my soul.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Then help me. Let us finish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Quickly.</i>] What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> I don't want to seem a prig. I don't want to preach. Heaven
knows, I've never pretended to be a saint. But what we've done is wrong.
You must see that as plainly as I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Is it wrong to love? How can I help it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Daisy, I want to&mdash;cease doing wrong.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> You make me impatient. How can you be so weak?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> I want you to believe that I love you. But I can't go on with
this deceit. I'd sooner shoot myself.<a name="page_114" id="page_114"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> You couldn't say that if you loved me as I love you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>Brutally.</i>] I <i>don't</i> love you any more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>With a scornful shrug.</i>] That's not true.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>Clenching his teeth.</i>] I came here to-day to tell you
that&mdash;well, that it's finished and done with. Oh, God, I don't want to
make you unhappy! But you must see we can't go on. Everything that's
decent in me revolts at the thought. I beseech you to forget me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> As if I could.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> I'm going away for a bit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Startled.</i>] You? Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> I didn't trust myself, you see; I've lost my nerve, so I applied
for short leave. I'm sailing for Vancouver on the <i>Empress</i>. I leave
here the day after to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Suddenly distraught.</i>] You don't mean that you're going to
leave me? I didn't pay any attention to what you said. I thought it was
just a mood. George, George, say that you don't mean that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> It's the only thing to do, for your sake and Harry's and mine.
[<i>Taking his courage in both hands.</i>] This is good-bye, Daisy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Seizing him by the shoulders.</i>] Let me look at your eyes.
George, you're crazy. You can't go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>Drawing away.</i>] For God's sake, don't touch me. I wanted to
break it to you gently. I don't know what's happened. Everything has
gone wrong. I'm going, Daisy, and nothing in the world can move me. I
implore you to bear it bravely. [<i>She looks at him with suffering,
anxious eyes. She is stunned.</i>] I'm afraid you're going to be awfully
unhappy for a little while. But I beseech you to have courage. Soon the
pain won't be so great, and then you'll see I've done the only possible
thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Sullenly.</i>] How long are you going for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Three or four months. [<i>A pause.</i>] I knew<a name="page_115" id="page_115"></a> you'd be brave,
Daisy. Do you know, I was afraid you'd cry most awfully. It tears my

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> Oh, no, he got away in fairly decent time. Where there's a will

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>With a little laugh.</i>] Oh, I know! I'm expecting him here in a
minute. I hope you won't have to go before he comes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> Well, I saw him yesterday. I can live one day without seeing
him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I wonder if he can live one day without seeing you?</p>

He will chaff me about George Conway, so it makes me self-conscious when
anybody talks about him.</p>

love with him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> [<i>With a laugh.</i>] But I'm not in love with him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Why does your brother chaff you then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> Because he's under the delusion that it's funny.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> But you do like him, don't you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> Of course I like him.... I think he's a very good sort.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Would you marry him if he asked you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> My dear, what are you talking about? The thought never entered
my head.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Oh, what nonsense! When a man's as attentive to a girl as George
has been to you she can't help asking herself if she'd like to marry him
or not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> [<i>Coldly, but still smiling.</i>] Can't she? I'm afraid I haven't a
close acquaintance with that sort of girl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Am I being very vulgar? You know, we half-castes are sometimes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> [<i>With a trace of impatience.</i>] Of course you're not vulgar. But
I don't know why you want to talk about something that's absolute Greek
to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> The natural curiosity of the Eurasian. Everybody tells me that
you're engaged to George.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> Daisy was wondering.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>Shaking hands with Sylvia.</i>] I thought that was your pony
outside.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> Clever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> The Fergusons were just riding up as I came.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> Oh, they've come to fetch me! I must bolt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> I'm afraid we kept you up till all sorts of hours last night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> Not a bit. Do I look jaded?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Of course not. You young things can stay up till three in the
morning and be as fresh as paint. Wait till you're my age.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> You haven't passed your hundredth birthday yet, have you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Not quite. But I'm old enough to be your father.</p>

Do come and see me one day this week.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Good-bye.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> I'll come and help you mount, shall I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> Oh, no, don't bother! Mr. Ferguson is there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Oh, all right!</p>

<p>[<i>She goes out.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Her smiles vanishing, hostile and cold.</i>] You might shut the

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> You said you wanted to see me very importantly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> It's kind of you to have come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>With an effort at ease of manner.</i>] My dear child, what are
you talking about? You must know that if there's anything in the world I
can do for you I'm only too anxious to do it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Is that girl in love with you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Good heavens, no! What put that idea in your head?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> The eyes in my head.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> What perfect nonsense!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Has it never occurred to you that she was in love with you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Never.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Why do you lie to me? I've been told that you were engaged to
her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> That's ludicrous. It's absolutely untrue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Yes, I think it is. At the first moment I believed it. And then I
thought it over and I knew it couldn't be true. I don't think you'd do
anything underhand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> At all events I shouldn't do that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> In fairness to me or in fairness to her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> My dear Daisy, what are you talking about?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Did you break with me yesterday so that you might be free to
propose to her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> No, I swear I didn't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Why are you so emphatic?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Oh, Daisy, what's the good of tormenting yourself and tormenting
me? You know I loved you just as much as you loved me. But I'm not like
you. It was a torture. I knew it was wrong and hateful. I couldn't go
on.<a name="page_127" id="page_127"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Do you think it would have seemed wrong and hateful if it hadn't
been for Sylvia?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> You don't say that very convincingly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> I do think it is because she is so loyal, and good and straight
that I saw so clearly what a cad I was. I think I found courage to do
the only possible thing in her frankness and honesty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I think you deceive yourself. Are you sure this admiration of
yours for all her admirable qualities isn't&mdash;love?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> My dear, I'm unfit to love her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> She doesn't think so. If you asked her to marry you she'd accept.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>Impatiently.</i>] What nonsense. What in heaven's name made you
think that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I made it my business to find out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>Startled.</i>] Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> You know those letters. I kept them locked in the box. Lee Tai

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Oh, poor Harry!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Don't think of him now. Think of me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> What do we matter now, you and I? We're a pair of rotters. Harry
is a white man through and through. He loved you, and he trusted me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> What are we going to do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Give me a minute. I'm all at sixes and sevens. It's such a
knock-out blow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Harry will be here soon. His train's due at five.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> We'll wait for him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Did you think I was going to run away? I'll stay and face him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> He'll kill you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>With anguish.</i>] I wish to God he would.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Oh, George, how can you be so cruel? Don't you love me any more?
I love you. George, what is to become of me if you desert me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Harry loves you so much and he loves me too. Heaven knows what
sacrifices he's not capable of. Oh, I'm so ashamed!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Why do you bother about him? He doesn't count. He'll get over it.
After all, what can he do? He can only divorce me and perhaps we can get
him to let me divorce him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Could you <i>allow</i> him to do that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> It means so little to a man. I don't care, I was thinking of you.
It would make it so much easier for you. [<i>He gives her a quick look. He
perceives the allusion to marriage.</i>] George, George, you wouldn't
leave&mdash;leave me in the cart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Of course I'll marry you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Smiling now, loving and tender.</i>] Oh, George, we shall be so
happy. And you know, some day I'm sure<a name="page_129" id="page_129"></a> you'll think it's better as it's
turned out. I hate all this deceit just as much as you do. Oh, it'll
make such a difference when our love can be open and above board. When
I'm your wife you'll forget all that has tormented you. Oh, George, I
know we shall be happy!</p>

<p>[<i>All this time</i> <span class="smcap">George</span> <i>has been thinking deeply</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> How do you know that Lee Tai sent those wretched letters to
Harry?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> He sent me a message. He wasn't satisfied with doing a dirty
trick. He wanted me to know that he'd done it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> How did he know you kept my letters there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I told you I was reading them while I waited for you. He came in
and I put them away. I suppose he suspected. It was very easy for him to
get into the room after amah and I went away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>Sarcastically.</i>] Had you left the key of the box on the table?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> What do you mean, George? I'd locked it up. Of course I took the
key with me. I suppose he broke it open. What does it matter? The harm's
done.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> How do you know Harry received the letters this morning?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Lee Tai said he would.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> In Kalgan?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> How did he know Harry was in Kalgan?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> The Chinese know all one's movements.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> They can't do miracles. Harry was going up there unexpectedly on
a private mission. The fellows in that company know very well how to
keep their own counsel when it's needful.... I imagine you were the only
person in Peking who knew Harry was going to Kalgan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Casually.</i>] Well, it appears I wasn't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> How do you suppose Lee Tai found out something<a name="page_130" id="page_130"></a> that Harry had
particularly told you to keep quiet about?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> How can I tell? He may have found out from the amah for all I
know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Surely you hadn't told her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Of course not. She may have read the letter. She always does read
my letters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Can she read English?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Enough to find out about other people's business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Why should she have told Lee Tai?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I suppose he bribed her. She'd do anything for a hundred dollars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Not if it would do you harm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> She's not so devoted to me as all that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> She's your mother, Daisy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Quickly.</i>] How d'you know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Harry told me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I thought he was too ashamed of it to do that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>Persistently.</i>] How did Lee Tai know that Harry was in Kalgan?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I tell you I don't know. Why do you cross-examine me? Good God,
I'm harassed enough without that! What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>He seizes her wrists and draws her violently to him.</i>] Daisy,
did you send those letters to Harry yourself?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Never! Do you think I'm crazy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Did you give them to Lee Tai to send?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> God damn you, speak the truth! I will have the truth for once in
your life.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">[<i>They stare at one another. He is stern and angry. She pulls
herself together. She is fierce and defiant. She shakes herself
free of him.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I gave them to Lee Tai.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>Hiding his face with his hands.</i>] My God!<a name="page_131" id="page_131"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> He told me you were engaged to Sylvia. For a moment I believed it
and I gave him the letters. I hardly knew what I was doing. And now,
even though I know it wasn't true, I'm glad. I wish I'd done it long
before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> You fiend!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>Violently.</i>] Do you think I'm going to let you go so easily? Do
you think I've done all I have to let you marry that silly little
English girl?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>With anguish.</i>] Oh, Daisy, how could you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Has it never struck you how you came to be wounded that night? It
wasn't you they wanted. It was Harry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> I know. [<i>Suddenly understanding.</i>] Daisy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Yes, I could do that. I only wish it had succeeded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> I can't believe it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> You're mine, mine, mine, and I'll never let you go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>With increasing violence.</i>] Do you think I can ever look at
you again without horror? In my heart I've known always that you were
evil. Ten years ago when I first loved you there was a deep instinct
within that warned me. Even though my heart was breaking for love of you
I knew that you were ruthless and cruel. I've loved you, yes, but all
the time I've hated you. I've loved you, but with the baser part of me.
All that was in me that was honest and decent and upright revolted
against you. Always, always. This love has been a loathsome cancer in my
heart. I couldn't rid me of it without killing myself, but I abhorred
it. I felt that I was degraded by the love that burned me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> What do I care so long as you love? You can think anything you
like of me. The fact remains that you love me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> If you had no pity for Harry, who raised you from the gutter and
gave you everything he had to give,<a name="page_132" id="page_132"></a> oh, if you'd loved me you'd have
had mercy on me. What do you think our life can be together? Don't you
know what I shall be? Ruined and abject and hopeless. Oh, not only in
the eyes of everyone who knows me shall I be degraded, but in my own. Do
you think there's much happiness for you there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I shall have you. That's all the happiness I want. I'd rather be
wretched with you&mdash;oh, a thousand times&mdash;than happy with anyone else.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>Wrathfully, trying to wound her.</i>] You were tormenting me just
now because you were jealous of Sylvia. Do you know what I felt for her?
It wasn't love&mdash;at least not what you mean by love. I can never love
anyone as I've loved you and God knows I'm thankful. But I had such a
respect for her. I've been so wretched and she offered me peace. And I
did think that some day when all this horror was over, if I could do
something to make myself feel clean again, I should go to her and, all
unworthy, ask her if she would take me. And now the bitterest pang of
all is to think that she must know what an unspeakable cad I've always
been.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">[<i>He has flung himself into a chair. He is in despair.</i> <span class="smcap">Daisy</span> <i>goes
up to him and going down on her knees beside him puts her arm round
him. She is very tender</i>.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Oh, George, I can make you forget her so easily. You don't know
what my love can do. I know I've been horrible, but it's only been
because I loved you. Ten years ago I was all that she is. I'm like clay
in your hands and you can make me what you will. Oh, George, say you
forgive me!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">[<i>In the caressing gestures of her hands as she tries to move him
one of them rests by chance on his coat pocket. She feels something
hard. He moves slightly away.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Take care.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> What's that in your pocket?<a name="page_133" id="page_133"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> It's my revolver. Since my accident I've always carried it about
with me. It's rather silly, but the Minister asked me to. He said he'd
feel safer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Oh, George, if you only knew the agony I suffered when you were
brought in! The remorse, the fear! I thought I should go mad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>With a bitter chuckle.</i>] It must have been rather a sell for
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Oh, you can laugh! I knew you'd forgive me. My darling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> I'm sorry for all the rough things I said to you, Daisy. I don't
blame you for anything. You only acted according to your lights. The
only person I can blame is myself. It's only reasonable that I should
suffer the punishment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> My sweetheart!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> I suppose you know that I shall be quite ruined.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> You'll have to leave the service. Does that really matter to you
very much?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> It was my whole life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> You'll get a job in the post office. With your knowledge of the
language they'll simply jump at you. It's a Chinese service. It has
nothing to do with Europeans.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Do you think the postmaster in a small Chinese city is a very
lucrative position?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> What does money matter? If I'd wanted money I could have got all
I wanted from Lee Tai. We can do with very little. You don't know what a
clever housekeeper I am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>In a level, dead voice.</i>] I'm sure you're wonderful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> We'll go to some city where there are no foreigners. And we shall
be together always. We'll have a house high up on the bank and below us
the river will flow, flow endlessly.<a name="page_134" id="page_134"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> You seem to have got it all mapped out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> If you only knew how often I've dreamed of it. Oh, George, I want
rest and peace too! I'm so tired. I want endless days to rest in. [<i>With
a puzzled look at him.</i>] What is the matter? You look so strange.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>With a weary sigh.</i>] I was thinking of all the things you've
been saying to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> If you think it'll be easier for you if you don't marry me, you
need not. I don't care anything about that. I'll be your mistress and
I'll lie hidden in your house so that no one shall know I'm there. I'll
live like a Chinese woman. I'll be your slave and your plaything. I want
to get away from all these Europeans. After all, China is the land of my
birth and the land of my mother. China is crowding in upon me; I'm sick
of these foreign clothes. I have a strange hankering for the ease of the
Chinese dress. You've never seen me in it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Never.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>With a smile.</i>] You'd hardly know me. I'll be a little Chinese
girl living in the foreigner's house. Have you ever smoked opium?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> No. [<span class="smcap">Daisy</span> <i>takes the</i> <span class="smcap">Amah's</span> <i>long pipe in her hands.</i>] Who
does that belong to?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> It's amah's. One day you shall try and I'll make your pipes for
you. Lee Tai used to say that no one could make them better than I.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> However low down the ladder you go there's apparently always a
rung lower.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> After you've smoked a pipe or two your mind grows extraordinarily
clear. You have a strange facility of speech and yet no desire to speak.
All the puzzles of this puzzling world grow plain to you. You are
tranquil and free. Your soul is gently released from the bondage of your
body, and it plays, happy and careless, like a child with flowers. Death
cannot frighten you, and want and misery are like blue mountains far
away. You feel a heavenly power possess you and you can venture all
things<a name="page_135" id="page_135"></a> because suffering cannot touch you. Your spirit has wings and
you fly like a bird through the starry wastes of the night. You hold
space and time in the hollow of your hand. Then you come upon the dawn,
all pearly and gray and silent, and there in the distance, like a
dreamless sleep, is the sea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> You are showing me a side of you I never knew.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Do you think you know me yet? I don't know myself. In my heart
there are secrets that are strange even to me, and spells to bind you to
me, and enchantments so that you will never weary.</p>

<p>[<i>A pause.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> [<i>Standing up.</i>] I'll go and get myself a drink. After all these
alarums and excursions I really think I deserve it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Amah will bring it to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Oh, it doesn't matter! I can easily fetch it myself. The
whisky's in the dining-room, isn't it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I expect so.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">[<i>He goes out.</i> <span class="smcap">Daisy</span> <i>goes over to a chest which stands in the

locked</i>. <span class="smcap">Daisy</span> <i>puts down the headdress and looks at the door
enquiringly</i>.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> [<i>With a little smile.</i>] What are you locking the door for,

happen? George! George!</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
